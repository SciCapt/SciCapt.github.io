      <h2> Hello! </h2>
        My name is Sean Saliga and I am currently a Physics student at the University of Florida with an expected graduation of May 2023. The skills I mostly take pride in, as mentioned in my <a href=".docs/assets/Resume.pdf" download>resume</a>, are coding in Python, my understanding of circuits, and my ability to work with other people. If you're interested, please feel free to read below about my interests and hobbies!
        <br><br>
        When I first went into physics in 2020, it was because I wanted to follow the traditional route earning a PhD and continuing into research. Since then, I've had a few opportunities (and inspirations, thanks Tony Stark) that have helped me figure out I'm meant more for R&D environments. For example, the idea of working on the latest technologies ike ion engines, fusion power, etc. sounds like what I'd do in my garage for fun.
        <br><br>
        Physics allows me to appreciate why something happens, but I also want to know the "what" that comes from engineering showing me what it takes to make something work. I've realized this idea in the recent years, and from it, have gained a lot. A lot of what I've gained I get to show off in the form of my <a href="https://scicapt.github.io/Projects">hobby projects</a>. On the page for those, you will find various coding projects, thought experiments, desings, etc. I've made. Most of these I've completed in my free time as this is simply what I'm interested in.
