      Started earlier in 2022, this was a project I wanted to complete to gain skills in many areas of Python. This includes organizing large projects, making use of custom functions, making my own GUI, etc. There are two main goals I have associated with this project -- 1. Make a bug-free chess game engine all on my own and 2. Use my custom-made game as a platform to create and test chess AIs. Both of these have been largely completed, though there is still room for perfection.

      Started in one of the many notebooks I have for my various project ideas, this design is one of many I've experimented with. Currently, this design is my favorite as it accomplishes the main goal I had -- specifically, to have a custom combustion engine design, but based on circular motion, unlike traditional piston-based engines.

      This project was completed as a final project for a physics lab class I took early in 2022. For this project, we were allowed to independently choose what we wanted the circuit to do. I have experimented with many kinds of circuits before, thanks to the electrical engineering tools of my own I have, but I haven't ever tried a radio. This project satisfies a few goals I had -- one, to see how fast of an oscillator I could make from my skills, and two, to use that oscillator to make a morse code-style transmitter and reciever.
