  <h1>Chess In Python</h1>
  <p>
    This project technically started in April of 2022, but used a GUI based on the MatLab plotting for python. There were multiple reasons for why that was a nightmare to work with, so I instead opted to make my own GUI more or less from scratch.
    <br><br>
    Luckily around the same time, I had played around with using the Windows command prompt to display a black and white screen based on a certain array/image given to it. An example of this is given below where an equation is given to the code which is then graphed, in this case, that is a modified sine wave:

    By then making the sprites of the chess board and pieces using this same array definition idea, I could instead then print them onto a larger array, i.e. the chess board:
